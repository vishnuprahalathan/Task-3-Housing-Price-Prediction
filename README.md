# Task-3-Housing-Price-Prediction

This project aims to predict housing prices based on various independent features using multiple regression techniques.  
It covers complete data cleaning, encoding, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

Project Overview

- Dataset: `Housing.csv` containing features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, air conditioning, etc.
- Objective: Predict the `price` of houses based on provided features using machine learning regression techniques.

Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

Project Workflow

1. Data Loading
- Loaded dataset from `C:\Users\Vishnu Prahalathan\Desktop\Housing.csv`.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Dropped missing value rows.
- Identified and selected `price` as the target variable.
- Encoded categorical columns:
  - Converted binary columns (`yes`/`no`) into `1` and `0`.
  - One-hot encoded multi-category column `furnishingstatus`.

3. Saving Cleaned Dataset
- Saved the cleaned dataset as `Housing_Cleaned.csv` on Desktop.

4. Feature Scaling
- Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize the features before feeding into models.

5. Model Training
- Built a Multiple Linear Regression model.
- Additionally built Ridge and Lasso regression models for comparison.

6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using the following metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

7. Feature Importance Analysis
- Identified the most influential features on housing price prediction.

 8. Visualizations
- Correlation heatmap between all features.

Important Notes

- Feature scaling was critical because Ridge and Lasso are sensitive to magnitudes.
- Encoding categorical variables was necessary to avoid `ValueError` during scaling.
- One-hot encoding avoids introducing false order among categories like `furnishingstatus`.
- Ridge and Lasso helped explore regularization impact on model performance.
